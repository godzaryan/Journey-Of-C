## ⚙️ Installation

To get started with the codes in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/C-Journey.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd C-Journey
    ```

3. **Compile and run the code**:
    - For individual files:
      ```bash
      gcc -o output Basics/hello_world.c
      ./output
      ```

## 🚀 Usage

Each directory contains C files related to specific topics. You can navigate through these directories and run the examples to see the output and understand how they work. For instance, to run the `hello_world.c` program:

```bash
gcc Basics/hello_world.c -o hello_world
./hello_world
```

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **Basics**: Understanding the syntax, data types, and basic I/O.
- **Control Structures**: Implementing conditional statements and loops.
- **Functions**: Creating and using functions, including recursion and function pointers.
- **Data Structures**: Exploring arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
- **Projects**: Building real-world applications to solidify understanding.
